The NWE problem was introduced by Oded Regev in 2005 (who won the 2018 Godel Prize for this work).
Regev showed that the LWE problem is as hard to solve as several worst-caselattice problems.
It is based on the idea of representing secret information as a set of equations with errors.
In other wods, LWE is a way to hide the value of a secret by introducing noise to it.
